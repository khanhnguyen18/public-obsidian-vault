## 31. EC2 
### EC2 - Pricing
- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/


### 32.

## 57

* EBS snapshot archive: 75% cheaper

## EFS
- Provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
- Storing data within and across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and durability
- EC2 instances can access your file system across AZs, regions, and VPCs 
- On-premises servers can access using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.

- #1.13: You can connect to EFS file systems from EC2 instances in other AWS regions using an inter-region VPC peering connection, and from on-premises servers using an AWS VPN connection


## 69. High Availability and Scalability

* High Avallability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal
* High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers == AZ)

â€¢ Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of instances ðŸ˜Š scale out / in)

* Auto Scaling Group
* Load Balancer

â€¢ High Availability:

* Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
* Auto Scaling Group multi AZ

## 70. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) 
- ELB and Global Accelerator solve the challenge of routing user requests to healthy application endpoints.
-  AWS Global Accelerator relies on ELB to provide the traditional load balancing features such as support for internal and non-AWS endpoints, pre-warming, and Layer 7 routing. 
- Provides load balancing within one Region, AWS Global Accelerator provides traffic management across multiple Regions.
- Include
  - ALB
  - NLB
### Application Load Balancer (ALB)



## 72. ALT

* x-forward-for

## 73. ALB demo

* Create target group
* Practice load balancer

## 74

* Only allow access from ALB
* Define condition rule

## 78

* Sticky cooki

## 79 Cross zone Load Balancing

## 81 SSL Hand on

Add listener

## 83 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
â€¢ Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
â€¢ Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
â€¢ Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of EC2 instances running
â€¢ Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
â€¢ Re-create an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated (ex: if unhealthy)

 ![alt text](image-41.png)
Auto Scaling - CloudWatch Alarms & Scaling
â€¢ It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms
â€¢ An alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU, or a custom metric)
â€¢ Metrics such as Average CPU are computed for the overall ASG instances

   \[LINK\](This is a link)
   dns

## Question

* Subnet: Span all azs


 ![alt text](image-48.png)

* *DNS Record Time*:
   ![alt text](image-49.png)

   ![alt text](image-50.png)
* *Go to AWS Cloudshell*
  * sudo yum install -y bind-utils
  * nslookup  test.steahan...
  * dig

## 105 EC2 setup

* Create 3 EC2
* Create load balancer

## 106 TTL(Time to live)

* \

## 107. CNam and Alias

 ![alt text](image-51.png)

* Alias: Point hostname to aws resource
* CName not for apex record

## Route 53 
- Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. Route 53 is ruled out as the company wants to continue using its own custom DNS service.

## 127 S3

* So3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
* *Prefix* = Directory
*  ![alt text](image-52.png)
* Bucket
* Object
  * Metadata
  * Tags
  * Version ID(if enable)
* Default *encrytiokn*
  * SSE-S3
  * KMS

### S3 Security

- User base
  - Which url could use for specific user
- Resource Base
  - Bucket Policies: 
  - Object Access Controler LIst - Finer Grant
  - Bucket(ACL)

## 130 Bucket policy

* Use tool to generate policy

## Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration(S3TA)
- enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. 
- Takes advantage of *Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed edge locations*.
- As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
- Pay only for transfer that are accelerated
## S3 â€“ Requester Pays

* With Requester Pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket

## S3 - Access Point

* VPC Origin - *DNS Name*
* EC2 could create VPC Enpoint(Gateway or Interface Endpoint)


## 163 - S3 - Object Standard



## Cloudfront
- CDN service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.
- CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure popular content can be served quickly to your viewers.
- has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that content.

### Origin failover feature

- support your data resiliency needs.
- If your content is not already cached in an edge location, 
    -> CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've identified as the source for the definitive version of the content.
#### 165 Cloudfront with S3

* Origin access
* Distribution

## 170. Global Accelator
- Utilizes the Amazon global network, allowing you to improve the performance of your applications by:
    1. lowering first-byte latency(the round trip time for a packet to go from a client to your endpoint and back again)
    2. jitter (the variation of latency)
    3. increasing throughput (the amount of time it takes to transfer data) as compared to the public internet
- Provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions such as ALB, NLB, EC2 instances. 
- Improve wide range of app(TCP, UDP) by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
- Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.
- AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery), while Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP.
- not help in accelerating the file transfer speeds into S3 for the given use-case.
- When go public internet - A lot of latency because there many hops
- Unicast IP: 1 server 1 IP
- Any Cast IP: Same Ip, client is routed to near on
- Global Accelator: Talk to closed Edge location -> Public ALP
- Create Private AWS network
- Perform healcheck for your app

# AWS Direct Connect
- Establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. 
- AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.
- With *AWS Direct Connect* plus *VPN*, you can combine one or more AWS Direct Connect dedicated network connections with the *Amazon VPC VPN*. This combination provides an *IPsec-encrypted private connection* that also reduces network costs, increases bandwidth throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than internet-based VPN connections.
- Involves significant monetary investment and takes at least a month to set up, therefore it's not the correct fit for this use-case.

## AWS Transit Gateway
-  A network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPC) and on-premises networks. AWS Transit Gateway by itself cannot establish a low latency and high throughput connection between a data center and AWS Cloud.

## AWS site-to-site VPN
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). 
- A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. 
- VPN Connections are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. 
- However, Site-to-site VPN cannot provide low latency and high throughput connection, therefore this option is ruled out.


## AWS Snow Family

* Ops Hub
* Data transfer

- *AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized*: It provides up to 80 Terabytes of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gigabytes network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.
- Snowmobile: 100 petabyte in one location

## Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
- provides all of the benefits of a native Windows SMB environment that is fully managed and secured and scaled like any other AWS service. You get detailed reporting, replication, backup, failover, and support for native Windows tools like DFS and Active Directory.
;'lopfdpgtikdcxojjgtkfidcncibdcl  support file shares in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, so this option is incorrect.
- Amazon FSx File Gateway: low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. For applications deployed on AWS, you may access your file shares directly from Amazon FSx in AWS
## 178 Storage gateway

* Block storage
* Object Storgae
* File gate
* NFS
* Active Story
* iScis
* *Volume Gateway*
  * Cached Volume
  * Stored Volumne:


### File gateway
- https://d1.awsstatic.com/cloud-storage/Amazon%20FSx%20File%20Gateway%20How%20It%20Works%20Diagram.edbf58e4917d47d04e5a5c22132d44bd92733bf5.png

- File Gateway does not support file shares in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, so this option is incorrect.

## 187 SQS Fifo queue
- Limited throughput : 300 msg/s without batching, max: 10 message per operation = 3000 msg/s

## Kinesis Data Stream
- Ingest real-time data or streaming data at large scales.
- KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources. 
- The data collected is available in milliseconds, enabling real-time analytics. 
- KDS provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications.


## Firehose
- Ingest data and post to another source
  - S3
  - 

!- Delivery Stream:

## Analytics

## 218. Lambda
- run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consumeâ€”thereâ€™s no charge when your code isnâ€™t running.
- currently supports 1000 concurrent executions per AWS account per region.
- If your Amazon SNS message deliveries to AWS Lambda contribute to crossing these concurrency quotas, your Amazon SNS message deliveries will be throttled. You need to contact AWS support to raise the account limit
- Integrates natively with Kinesis Data Streams. The polling, checkpointing, and error handling complexities are abstracted when you use this native integration. The processed data can then be configured to be saved in Amazon DynamoDB.
### 219. Lambda SnapStart

* For Java
* Snap start -> Function is preitnitize

## 225. Dynamodb Advanced Features

### DynamoDB Accelerator(DAX)

* *in- memory cache* for *DynamoDB*
* Help solve read congestion by caching
* Microseconds latency for cached data
* Doesnâ€™t require application logic modification (compatible with existing DynamoDB APIs)
* 5 minutes TTL for cache (default)
   ![alt text](image-59.png)

* Same Kinesis


### Global table

* Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple-regions
* Active-Active replication
* Applications can READ and WRITE to the table in any region
* Must enable DynamoDB Streams as a pre-requisite

  \


### TimeTolive

* Automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp
* Use cases: reduce stored data by keeping only current items, adhere to regulatory obligations, web session handling...


## API GATEWAY
- Amazon API Gateway to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. 
- APIs act as the front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. 
- Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications.
